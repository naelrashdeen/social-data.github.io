title: San Fransisco, a focused crime story
---

# Background

San Fransisco, a city known for its iconic Golden Gate Bridge, vibrant culture and Silicon Valley has long grappled with public safety challenges.

The dataset at hand helps us understand this narrative, through police incident reports from 2003 to May 2018 - helping us gain an insight into the city's battle with criminal activities through quantative measures. Each entry in the dataset is a moment of conflict with the law - capturing not just a snapshot of unlawful acts but visualising the larger story of San Fransisco's evovling socio-economic landscape.

Containing 32 unique categories of crime, the ground reality mirrors the challenges and societal shits that San Fransisco has faced during the years. The high occurences of drug-related crimes along with incidents of larceny and burgulary shows us the disparity between wealth and poverty on the same blocks. Furthermore, instances of violent crime such as assault and robbery - punctuate the city's narrative with urgent calls and effective policing.

We focus on a particular set of crimes and hope to shed light on the specific challenges they represent. Our objective is to provide a data-driven analysis that not only quantifies the city's struggles with crime but also offers insights into the ground reality among the population.
